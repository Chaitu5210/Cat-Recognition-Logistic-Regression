# Cat Recognition With Logistic Regression

## Overview
This project aims to recognize cats in images using logistic regression. The model is trained on a dataset of cat images to classify them accurately.

## Objectives
- Implement logistic regression for image classification.
- Evaluate model performance using metrics such as accuracy and confusion matrix.

## Dataset
- A collection of labeled images containing cats and non-cats.

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Resize images and normalize pixel values.
2. **Feature Extraction**: Convert images into a format suitable for logistic regression.
3. **Model Training**: Train the logistic regression model on the training dataset.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Test the model on unseen images and evaluate performance.

## Conclusion
The logistic regression model demonstrates effectiveness in recognizing cats in images, showcasing the potential for further development in image classification tasks.
